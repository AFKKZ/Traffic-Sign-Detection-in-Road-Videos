# Traffic Sign Detection in Road Videos
A simple program created to automatically apply rectangles and the traffic signs in a given video. 

# Main idea of the program
Figure out the color threshold to mask on and detect the traffic signs

Use the real traffic signs to get a template for the detection method

Use a loop to go through each frame and look for the sign

Create a function to find and verify the signs using the template
